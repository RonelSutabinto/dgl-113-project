## Proposal
Create a simple, responsive restaurant website. which only has four important pages: the landing page, about, menu, and contact page.

These are the highlights of the website's page. ï»¿

1. The landing page displays customer testimonials using a carousel layout, and I add a little bit of JavaScript code for carousel property alteration.

2. Creating a responsive hamburger menu that uses toggleClass, functions, and an event handler that is implemented in JavaScreipt.

3. On the menu page, I try to add a list of menu categories using the span element and CSS for the styling. I used querySelector to return the first element and classList to return the element properties from the category menu selection.
